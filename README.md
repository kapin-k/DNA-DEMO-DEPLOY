# DNA-DEMO-APP

**Description:**
- This project is about developing an interactive Android/iOS app which takes a scribble as an input from the user and returns a list of organisms with DNA sequence that closely matches the input scribble. The app is developed as a powerful, interactive tool to demo the newly developed DNA sequencer device to the public in a fun and interesting manner.

## DOCUMENTATION

### PREREQUISITES
-------------
- Node
- Installs Node.js and npm using Homebrew on macOS

```bash
brew install node
```

- Watchman
- Watchman exists to watch files and record when they change. It can also trigger actions (such as rebuilding assets) when matching files change.

```bash
brew install watchman
```

- Cocopods
- CocoaPods is an application level dependency manager for the Objective-C/Swift, that provides a standard format for managing external libraries.

```bash
sudo gem install cocoapods
```
- Make sure both Node.js and npm(node package manager) is installed correctly. The two commands below should return a version number as output.

```bash
node --version
```

```bash
npm --version
```

### BACK END
-------------

**The server is currently runnning on AWS instance**  _Contact developers for credentials_

- **Follow the below steps to make the application run on custom server:**

1. After cloning this project, move to directory '/dnademo/Components' and do the following:

* Open 'DrawingBoard.js' file
* Go to Line 27: Where you may see an URL for the Server (http://smarten-env.eba-9hfjufww.us-east-2.elasticbeanstalk.com)
* Change the URL to the URL of the desired Server

2. Navigate to directory '/dnademo/ios' and perform the following steps:

* i) Open 'dnademo.xcworkspace' using your Xcode
* ii) In the project navigator, expand the 'dnademo' project. You will now see a list of folders. Expand the folder 'dnademo', within which you will find a file called Info.plist.
* iii) Right click on 'Info.plist' --> 'Open As' --> 'Source Code'.
* iv) In Line 35, you may find the following - <key>smarten-env.eba-9hfjufww.us-east-2.elasticbeanstalk.com</key>
* Replace the existing domain name with the domain name of the desired server. (Dont include IP address or port number) Eg: <key>github.com</key>


**The following steps are for deploying it on a local machine, if you choose to go ahead with AWS Deployment, please skip this section and move to BUILD and DEPLOYMENT section. If you chose to deploy it on a local machine, please keep in mind that the IP address of the local host needs to be translated to a domain, without which the app won't connect to server** 

1. **Setting up Smarten-Demo app server**

- `smarten-demo-srv.py` must be configured such that `EXEC` variable points to the location of `db-search`. It is recommeded that `db-search` resides in the same directory as the database files and `smarten-demo-srv.py` itself.

- Navigate to '/DNA-DEMO-DEPLOY/dna-demo-server-AWS' and execute the following command:

    ```bash
        make
    ```
2. **Setting up proxy-server**

- Installing Flask API, navigate to '/DNA-DEMO-DEPLOY/dna-demo-server-AWS', then execute this command:
    
    ```bash
    pip3 install flask
    pip3 install flask_restful
    ```
3. **Starting the proxy-server**

- Navigate to '/DNA-DEMO-DEPLOY/dna-demo-server-AWS' and execute: 

    ```bash
    python3 application.py
    ```
The proxy-server is currently configured in such a way that when it is launched it takes the IP address of the host it is running on and accepts connections on port `5000` by default. It is adviced that you do not change any of the parameters for this. 
In case you need to change the parameters, here are the following steps: 
  open `application.py` file in directory '/DNA-DEMO-DEPLOY/dna-demo-server-AWS' : 
    
      For changing IP and port number : 
        
        Line No: 7 Change  `host_name = 'IP Address/domain name'`
        Line No: 8 Change  `port_no = <Port no>`
        
        'IP Address/domain name' => the IP address/domain name at which the server should accept incoming requests and connections. We adive you keep it as 0.0.0.0 or change it to the domain name if it needs to be changed. 
        <Port_No>    => Port number on which you which you want the proxy-server accepting the connections

If you have made any changes to host name or port number, then: 
* move to directory '/DNA-DEMO-DEPLOY/dnademo/Components'
* Go to Line 27: Where you may see an URL for the Server (http://smarten-env.eba-9hfjufww.us-east-2.elasticbeanstalk.com)
* Change the URL to the URL of the desired *Server along with the port number* if you have deployed it on local machine. 

**Happy Searching! The application will now be connceted to the desired server. :)**
